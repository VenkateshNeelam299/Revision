          "In the base class the method is declared as virtual and in derived class we override the same method.",
          "The virtual keyword indicates the method can be overridden in any drived class.",
          "A base class reference variable can point to a child class object.",
          "so we can assign a child class object to a base class reference variable. because a child class is a specialization of its base class. meaning a child class has all the capabilities of its base class plus additional features that child class has."
